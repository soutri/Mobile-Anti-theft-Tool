# Mobile-Anti-theft-Tool
This Mobile application was made as an academic group project.
1) The main aim of this project is to let the user get an alert if the sim in his phone has been changed via an sms(to the backup number)
   and email provided during the registration of the app.
2) It also has some features to turn on/off mobile data(works only on android versions lower than jelly bean) and to get user location,
    toggle from silent to general profile by simple sending some predefined codes for the respective tasks from an other device.
